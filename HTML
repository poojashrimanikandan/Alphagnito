    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>1 Meteorologists</strong> are weather scientists. They observe weather patterns. They use tools to measure temperature, wind speed, and other conditions. They use these observations to predict or forecast weather. They also use what they see to predict severe storms.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>2</strong> Severe storms have heavy winds. They also have heavy precipitation, such as rain or snow. These types of storms include: tornadoes, hurricanes, and blizzards. These storms are more likely in certain places during certain seasons. Still, they can be hard to predict.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>3</strong> Storm spotters can help predict and confirm storms. These trained volunteers look for signs of storms. They report their observations to meteorologists. Their findings help meteorologists make predictions. Storm spotters can help them track the movement and strength of a storm.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>4</strong> When meteorologists predict a storm, local government and news agencies send out a severe weather alert. This alert tells people when the storm will hit. It also tells them when to take shelter. Weather alerts can be announced in news reports. They can be text messages or outdoor warning sirens.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>5</strong> Severe storms can cause damage and unsafe conditions. When this happens, first responders make sure people are safe. They rescue people who are trapped by flooding or debris. They care for people who are hurt or need food, clothing, or shelter.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>6</strong> It is not easy to predict or prepare for some storms. One example is a waterspout. This type of tornado forms quickly over oceans and lakes. They can be rare in places like Hawaii. But even rare storms can cause damage.</p>
